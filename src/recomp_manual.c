/**
 * Manual function overrides and ICALL diagnostics
 *
 * This file provides:
 *   - recomp_lookup_manual()  : intercept specific Xbox VAs with hand-written code
 *   - recomp_icall_fail_log() : log when an indirect call target can't be resolved
 *   - ICALL trace ring buffer  : globals used by the RECOMP_ICALL macro
 *
 * The recomp pipeline generates an auto-dispatch table (recomp_lookup) that
 * resolves most function addresses. recomp_lookup_manual() is called FIRST,
 * giving you a chance to override any function with a custom implementation.
 *
 * Common reasons to add manual overrides:
 *   - Trace a function to understand call flow (wrap the generated version)
 *   - Fix a function the lifter translated incorrectly
 *   - Stub out a function that crashes (return early, set eax to a safe value)
 *   - Redirect a function to a native implementation (e.g., skip CRT init)
 *   - Intercept D3D/audio calls for custom rendering or sound

/* ── ICALL trace ring buffer ───────────────────────────────── */

/*
 * These globals are written by the RECOMP_ICALL macro (defined in
 * recomp_types.h) every time an indirect call is dispatched. When a
 * crash occurs, the VEH handler or recomp_icall_fail_log() can dump
 * the last 16 call targets to help you trace what happened.
 *
 * The runtime owns them: xbox_kernel defines all three in
 * src/kernel/xbox_memory_layout.c, and recomp_types.h declares them extern.
 * Declare, do not define -- a definition here as well is a duplicate symbol,
 * and a project copied from this template failed to link on all three:
 *
 *   xbox_memory_layout.obj : error LNK2005: g_icall_count already defined
 *                            in recomp_manual.obj

 * given that same answer now rather than "not yet": the slot is completed as
 * visible and the original function reads it. When the executor reaches the
